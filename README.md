## An analysis of paleo-present climate data

***
In this project:
1. Analyse CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs â€“ present.
2. Examine one other (paleo/modern) features - Sea Level.
3. Examine Irish context.
4. Fuse and analyse data from various data sources and format fused data set as a pandas dataframe and export to csv and json formats.
5. For all of the above variables, analyse the data, the trends and the relationships between them (temporal leads/lags/frequency analysis).
6. Predict global temperature anomaly over next few decades (synthesise data) and compare to published climate models if atmospheric CO2 trends continue.
7. Comment on accelerated warming based on very latest features.
